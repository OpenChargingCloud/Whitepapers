# Secure Dynamic QR-Codes for OCPP

The [EU Alternative Fuels Infrastructure Regulation (AFIR)](https://transport.ec.europa.eu/transport-themes/clean-transport/alternative-fuels-sustainable-mobility-europe/alternative-fuels-infrastructure_en) demands a secure payment process for charging stations. One way to ensure this security is to replace todays static *QR-Code stickers* with ***Secure Dynamic QR-Codes*** on the display of a charging station.
 
This approach is already part of the *Open Charge Point Protocol v2.1*. Goal of this paper is to describe this feature in greater details, to provide a backport to OCPP v1.6 and to describe extensions, that might be part of future OCPP versions.
