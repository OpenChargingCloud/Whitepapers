# OCPP Self Tests

As the complexity and criticality of electric vehicle (EV) charging infrastructure increases, the need for robust and transparent self-diagnostic capabilities in charging stations becomes paramount. Currently, the Open Charge Point Protocol (OCPP) lacks a standardized mechanism to explicitly define, trigger, and monitor self tests within its core message set and device model. This gap leads to proprietary extensions, inconsistent implementations, and reduced interoperability across manufacturers and management systems.

An explicit self test model, tightly integrated into the OCPP device model and request/response framework, would enable charge point operators and backend systems to reliably enumerate, parameterize, and execute a wide range of self-diagnosticsâ€”ranging from simple software integrity checks to complex hardware validation routines. By describing available tests, their required parameters, operational constraints, and expected outcomes in a machine-readable and discoverable manner, operators gain better tools for remote maintenance, troubleshooting, and regulatory compliance.

Importantly, self tests should not only be accessible for manual execution by human operators or for periodic automated routines, but also be available to intelligent software agents and AI-based diagnostic systems. Such agents can proactively trigger or sequence self tests in response to anomalies, performance degradation, or security incidents, enabling more effective root cause analysis and faster problem resolution within the charging infrastructure.

Moreover, a standardized self test model supports automation of periodic health checks, real-time fault isolation, and evidence-based reporting for quality assurance and cybersecurity audits. It also facilitates seamless backend integration, future-proofing OCPP deployments against evolving reliability and safety requirements in critical infrastructure. Therefore, the introduction of a formal self test model in OCPP is essential for improving the transparency, resilience, and maintainability of EV charging networks.
